 STEFAN SCHLESINGER's TELEFONBAND GENERATOR v1


 This code is public domain. I'd be glad to hear from you if you like it. Write
 an e-mail to sts <at> ono <dot> at. :-)


 This is a small shell script I created, when I had to change our PBX's
 telefonbands the third time. It will create MP3's which you can use as
 telefonband from a textfile, by  using OSX's build in TTS engine.

 You should run it on Lion, with a couple of Voices installed, see the next
 section for detailed information. The TTS voices on previous OSX versions
 suck.


 PREREQUISITE
 
   Install the following tools via homebrew:

       libmad
       sox
       lame

   Download the following TTS voices to your OSX (System Settings -> Speech):
   Steffi, Samantha, Virginie.

   Place a file called 'loop.mp3', a 'mono' channel background music file, with
   a samplerate of 22050 Hz in this directory.
   Audacity comes in handy when you need to cut and sample it correctly.


 USAGE

   Create your voice texts in the text/ directory. One text by file, with the
   following naming schema: $title-$lang.txt, eg. closed-en.txt or
   waiting-de.txt.

   Simple Example

     Make sure to add a couple of seconds of silence before and after the text,
     so the caller will here the whole message.

     [[slnc 3000]]
     Unfortunately, all our lines are busy at the moment. Please
     try again later or send us an  email to: [[ctxt WORD]]example, @ example
     dot com.[[ctxt NORM]], and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

     Thank you, Goodbye!
     [[slnc 2000]]

   Example waiting loop (speech every 15secs, otherwise music):

     [[slnc 5000]]
     One moment please, the next free line is reserved for you.
     [[slnc 15000]]
     All our lines are busy at the moment, please hold the line.
     [[slnc 10000]]

  Now run ./telefonbandgenerator.sh and check for the output in the out/
  directory.
